      <h2>Setter</h2>
      <p class="DesPar" class="Par1">
        <strong>The setter</strong> is the main contributor to the offense of
        the volleyball team. One of the requirements of the setter is having a
        delicate touch to set the ball perfectly for one of the attacking
        players.

      <h2>Outside Hitter</h2>
      <p class="DesPar" class="Par2">
        The<strong> outside hitter</strong> also known ad the
        <strong>left-side hitter</strong> is the lead attacker in the offensive
        strategy. To be a successful outsider hitter, you must be able to jump
        high, be quick on your feet, and be ready to adapt to different
        situations. The volleyball won’t always be placed where the outsider
        hitter would like, so they need to be prepared for hits from a variety
        of places.

      <h2>Opposite Hitter</h2>
      <p class="DesPar" class="Par3">
        <strong>Opposite hitters</strong> need to be a perfect balance of both
        offense and defense. They will also get many opportunities to hit the
        volleyball, so similar to the outside hitter, jumping ability is vital.
        The main difference that sets the opposite hitter apart is their
        defensive responsibility. Being able to receive the serve from the
        opposing team is just one of the many requirements of this specialized
        position.

      <h2>Middle Blocker</h2>
      <p class="DesPar" class="Par4">
        <strong>The middle blocker</strong> is the tallest player on the
        volleyball team. Their main role for the team is being the first line of
        defense against the opposing team’s hits. The middle blocker needs to
        read the other team’s attackers to quickly raise his or her arms above
        the net in a blocking attempt. The middle blocker will also have chances
        for quick points throughout the set.

      <h2>Libero</h2>
      <p class="DesPar" class="Par5">
        <strong>Liberos</strong> can only play on the back row of the court, and
        because of this, are the ideal person to receive a hit from the opposite
        team. There are set rules the libero needs to follow, such as not
        attacking the ball at the net, playing a set for an attacker from the
        front, and more. You can always tell a libero apart from the rest of the
        team because they wear a different colored jersey.

      <h2>Defensive Specialist</h2>
      <p class="DesPar" class="Par6">
        The thing that sets the <strong>defensive specialist</strong> apart from
        other volleyball positions is their ability to substitute out any player
        on the court. This will count against the team’s total of 12
        substitutions. The defensive specialist traditionally focuses on ball
        control and passing and works well with the libero.
